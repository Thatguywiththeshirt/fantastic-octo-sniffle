**PART I: The Glitching City and the Whispering Game**

**EPISODE 1: Static and Silence**

**Logline:** Detective Alex Rourke investigates a series of disappearances linked to an arcade game, stumbling upon a victim's disturbing, glitch-filled audio diary in the neon-drenched rain of TwinSun Strand.

**(RUNTIME: approx. 18 minutes)**

**MUSIC:** [Opens with a melancholic, synth-heavy noir theme. Think Vangelis meets Blade Runner, with a touch of static.]

**SOUND:** [Heavy, persistent rain and distant, overlapping city sounds – neon hum, traffic wash, muffled sirens. Underscores the music.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE - Filtered, like a voice-over from a hard-boiled detective):** TwinSun Strand. 1985. The year never really changed here. Just the grit got thicker, the neon burned hotter, and the rain... the rain never stopped. It washed the grime off the streets, but it never touched the dirt underneath. That stuck to your soul like cheap chrome plating.

**SOUND:** [Music fades slightly under narration.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** My name's Rourke. Detective. Used to think I was cleaning up the city. Now, I just try to keep from getting swept away. This latest one… something about it felt different. Colder. Like the static on a dead channel.

**SOUND:** [Rain intensifies briefly, then settles back to heavy drizzle.]

**SCENE START**

**INT. GRIMY APARTMENT - NIGHT**

**SOUND:** [Drip, drip, drip of a leaky pipe. Distant city sounds. Rourke's slow, heavy footsteps on linoleum.]

**OFFICER JENKINS:** (Voice echoing slightly in the small space) In here, Detective. Not much to see. Just… empty.

**SOUND:** [Rourke's footsteps approach. A floorboard CREAKS.]

**ROURKE:** (Takes a deep breath, sighs) Empty. Yeah, that's the new standard. Three this month. Four, counting this one?

**JENKINS:** Four, sir. Marcus Thorne. Landlord hasn't seen him in three days. Neighbors heard nothing. Just… lights out.

**SOUND:** [Rourke kneels. The sound of cellophane being pulled taught (crime scene tape?).]

**ROURKE:** No forced entry?

**JENKINS:** Negative. Door was locked from the inside. Security feed from the hall… flickered out about the time he vanished. Just static for twelve hours. Convenient.

**ROURKE:** (Standing) Too convenient. Anything out of place? Anything at all?

**SOUND:** [Jenkins walks a few steps.]

**JENKINS:** Only this. Sat right on his desk terminal. Looks like… an old audio diary module. But it's beat to hell.

**SOUND:** [Jenkins picks up something small and plasticky. A faint CRACKLE of static.]

**ROURKE:** Let me see.

**SOUND:** [Jenkins hands it over. More static as Rourke handles it.]

**ROURKE:** (Turning it over) Feels… hot. Like it's been running constantly.

**JENKINS:** Forensics can pull the data, maybe? If it's not corrupted beyond saving.

**ROURKE:** (Pocketing the module) They'll try. Anything else?

**JENKINS:** His rig's still here. Looks like he was… playing something. An arcade game terminal jacked into his home network. Weird setup.

**SOUND:** [Rourke walks towards the sound of humming electronics.]

**ROURKE:** Arcade game? What kind?

**JENKINS:** Looks vintage. One of those big stand-up cabinets. But it's new. Sleek. Says… (Reading) "Casilda's Song." Ever heard of it?

**SOUND:** [A low, unsettling HUM from the game cabinet.]

**ROURKE:** (Beat) No. Can't say I have. Was it on?

**JENKINS:** Screen's dark now. Pulled the plug when we got here. But yeah, looked like it was just idling. Weird music loop coming from it, barely audible. Catchy, though.

**SOUND:** [Jenkins hums a short, off-key, simple, slightly unsettling melody – a few notes.]

**ROURKE:** (Sharp) Stop.

**JENKINS:** Huh?

**ROURKE:** Just… stop humming that. Something about it…

**SOUND:** [Silence, save for the rain and the dripping.]

**JENKINS:** Right. Sorry. Just… stuck in my head.

**ROURKE:** (Looking around the apartment) Alright. Secure the scene. Standard procedure. Log everything. Tell forensics that module is priority one. I'm going back to the precinct.

**JENKINS:** Yes, sir.

**SOUND:** [Rourke's footsteps recede. The dripping pipe, the rain, the distant city fade slightly.]

**SCENE END**

**SCENE START**

**INT. ROURKE'S OFFICE - NIGHT**

**SOUND:** [Rain against the window. The soft, rhythmic CLACKING of an old-school mechanical keyboard. Rourke typing a report.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** Back at the precinct. My office. Not much sanctuary. Just four walls and a terminal screen full of dead ends. Thorne was another ghost. No trace. Just that damn arcade game cabinet. Casilda's Song. Looked into it. OmniCorp licensed the distribution rights. Big rollout lately. Saturated the city. Perfect vector for… well, whatever this was.

**SOUND:** [Keyboard typing stops.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** The forensics report on the audio diary module came back. Partial recovery. Glitches, noise… but there was something there. Something recorded right up to the moment Thorne vanished.

**SOUND:** [Rourke inserts the module. A BEEP. Then, loud STATIC, interspersed with digital SCREECHES. This fades slightly to reveal a human voice struggling underneath.]

**VICTIM (AUDIO DIARY):** (Voice distorted, panicked, overlaid with static and digital pops) …it's calling… calling from the screen… it changed… the game changed…

**SOUND:** [More intense static, a WHINE.]

**VICTIM (AUDIO DIARY):** (Voice clearer but trembling) The music… it’s different now… not the game music… something… older… and the colors… yellow… everything’s turning yellow…

**SOUND:** [A sudden, sharp DIGITAL SHARD sound, like breaking glass in software.]

**VICTIM (AUDIO DIARY):** (Voice becoming sing-song, detached, terrifyingly calm) Under… under twin suns… the King… the King in Yellow… (Voice drops to a whisper) Find the city… lost to madness… Carcosa…

**SOUND:** [The voice cuts off abruptly. Replaced by pure, loud, violent STATIC and digital NOISE. It lasts for several seconds, then abruptly clicks off.]

**SOUND:** [Silence in the office. Just the rain.]

**ROURKE:** (Quietly, to himself) Carcosa? What the hell is Carcosa?

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** It was more than static. It was silence. The kind that felt absolute. The kind that told you whatever was happening wasn't just crime. It was… disappearing. Into something I didn't understand. And my gut told me that little box, that 'Casilda's Song' game… it was the key. A key I didn't know how to turn.

**SOUND:** [Rain continues. The synth-noir theme music returns, slowly building.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** I needed help. The kind that lived outside the wire. Beyond the reach of precinct bureaucracy and OmniCorp's long shadow. I needed someone who spoke code like a native tongue. Someone who knew the echoes in the dark corners of the net. I needed Neon Shadow.

**SOUND:** [Music swells, then fades out.]

**EPISODE 1 END**

---

**EPISODE 2: Echoes in the Code**

**Logline:** Rourke reluctantly enlists reclusive hacker Neon Shadow to investigate "Casilda's Song." While Neon Shadow probes the game's strange code, Rourke has a cryptic encounter with Elijah "Ghost" Caldwell, an archivist who speaks of "cursed melodies."

**(RUNTIME: approx. 19 minutes)**

**MUSIC:** [Opens with a cool, pulsing electronic beat mixed with glitchy sounds and faint echoes of the "Casilda's Song" melody.]

**SOUND:** [Digital hum, keyboard typing at impossible speed. The environment of Neon Shadow's den – could be anything from a sterile server room to a chaotic tech nest.]

**SCENE START**

**INT. NEON SHADOW'S DEN - NIGHT**

**SOUND:** [Fast, complex typing. Multiple BEEPING and WHIRRING sounds from tech. Maybe a holographic display HUM.]

**NEON SHADOW:** (Voice processed, cool, slightly bored) Yeah, Rourke? You know I don't do house calls. Or precinct calls. Or… calls. What's broken now? Your smart-fridge ordering anchovy ice cream again?

**ROURKE:** (Over comms, voice slightly distorted) This isn't a drill, Shadow. It's a case. People are vanishing. And there's a link. To a game.

**NEON SHADOW:** (Typing stops briefly) A game? Missing people? You think they just went looking for high scores and forgot to come back?

**ROURKE:** This isn't Pac-Man. It's called "Casilda's Song." OmniCorp distribution. Latest victim had one. Left behind… something nasty. An audio file full of noise and warnings about a yellow color and... "Carcosa."

**SOUND:** [A distinct, sharp digital SCRAPE sound.]

**NEON SHADOW:** (Voice loses some boredom, tinged with intrigue) "Carcosa"? OmniCorp? Go on.

**ROURKE:** We recovered his game cabinet. It's offline now, bagged and tagged. Standard issue hardware on the outside. But something's inside. Something that left that audio diary fried and Thorne gone. The code… forensics couldn't make sense of it. They said it looked… wrong. Layered. Like it was hiding something.

**NEON SHADOW:** (Typing resumes, faster now) "Wrong" code is my specialty. Forensic tech are grunts. They see weird, they call it wrong. I call it interesting. Send me the core dump from the game board. Everything you got. And the audio file. Scrubbed, of course. Wouldn't want any precinct backdoors sniffing around my systems.

**ROURKE:** You know the drill. It'll be encrypted, keyed to your cert. Just… be careful. The audio file… it’s messed up. Listen on a sandboxed rig.

**NEON SHADOW:** (Coolly) Careful is how I survive. Unlike the poor punters chasing virtual high scores. Send it through. Neon Shadow out.

**SOUND:** [Comm line CLICKS off.]

**SOUND:** [The sound of intense, rapid digital activity returns – data streams, calculations, system probes. Neon Shadow is already working.]

**NEON SHADOW:** (To themselves, a faint echo effect) Casilda's Song… Carcosa… OmniCorp playing games again? Let's see what kind of echo you're hiding in the code…

**SOUND:** [Music pulses, electronics whirring.]

**SCENE END**

**SCENE START**

**INT. TWINSUN STRAND - ARCHIVE - DAY**

**SOUND:** [Silence, broken only by the faint, dry RUSTLE of old paper, the occasional CREAK of old wood, and distant, muffled city sounds. The rain is less oppressive indoors.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** While Shadow dove into the digital abyss, I took a detour into the analogue one. There are places in TwinSun Strand the net can't reach. Dust motes dancing in stale air, secrets bound in brittle paper. And custodians who remember things the city wants to forget. Elijah Caldwell. "Ghost," they called him. For good reason.

**SOUND:** [Rourke's footsteps echo slightly on polished stone floors.]

**ROURKE:** Mr. Caldwell? Elijah Caldwell?

**SOUND:** [A slow, shuffling sound approaches.]

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Voice thin, ancient, hesitant) Who seeks the keeper of ghosts? Another one lost in the rain?

**SOUND:** [Caldwell's shuffling stops. He sounds close.]

**ROURKE:** Detective Alex Rourke. Police. I'm investigating some disappearances. Young man named Marcus Thorne, most recently. And others. Linked to… something strange.

**GHOST CALDWELL:** Strange? (A dry, humourless CHUCKLE) The city is built on strange, detective. But the *new* strange… that's what you smell of. The digital rot.

**ROURKE:** I was hoping you might have encountered something like this before. Something… outside the usual. The victim mentioned a name. Carcosa. And… a King in Yellow.

**SOUND:** [A sharp intake of breath from Caldwell. A CRACKLE of old paper being clutched.]

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Voice suddenly sharper, fearful) You… you heard those names? Where? Who spoke them?

**ROURKE:** An audio recording. Fragmented. Came from a device found with the victim. Next to an arcade game terminal. "Casilda's Song."

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Whispering) Casilda's Song… (He takes a shaky breath) The melody… it always starts with the melody… a cursed melody… worming its way in…

**ROURKE:** A cursed melody? What are you talking about, Mr. Caldwell?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (More lucid now, but still haunted) Decades ago… before the net… before the chrome… there were texts. Forbidden texts. Speaking of a play. A play called The King in Yellow. Read it… or even heard fragments… and it changed you. Showed you things… things that weren't here. A city… under two suns… a pallid mask… Carcosa…

**ROURKE:** You're saying this game… "Casilda's Song"… is connected to this ancient play?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Shakes his head slowly) Not connected, detective. It *is* the vector. The melody… the visuals… the code… they are the new Act One. Drawing you in. Preparing you for Act Two. The part that cracks the mind. The part that lets… *them*… look through the cracks.

**ROURKE:** "Them"? Who?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Sighs, frail again) The King… and his court. Things that reside… elsewhere. Waiting. Waiting for the door to be opened. And the city… this glittering, humming city… is a perfect lock to pick. So many minds… so many connections… so much static to hide in…

**ROURKE:** (Trying to process) So you're saying this game isn't just addictive… it's some kind of… signal? A psychic attack?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Steps back, rustling sounds) It's invitation. Enticement. The first steps down a stair you can't un-climb. The disappearances… they aren't vanishings, detective. They're… transition. Absorbed. Welcomed home… to Carcosa.

**SOUND:** [Caldwell shuffles away a few steps.]

**ROURKE:** Caldwell! Wait! You said you encountered this before? How? How did you stop it?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Distant voice) We didn't stop it. We broke. Some were lost. Some… lived with the echoes. I chose the dust. It's quieter here. But the melody… (A tremor in his voice) …it never truly leaves.

**SOUND:** [More shuffling, receding. A door CREAKS open and closes.]

**SOUND:** [Silence returns to the archive. Rourke stands alone.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** He left me in the quiet. With dust and ghosts. A crazy old man talking about cursed plays and other dimensions. Sounded like a street preacher gone digital. But the look in his eyes… and the way he reacted to the names… it wasn't just madness. It was fear. The kind that knows what it's running from. Carcosa. Casilda's Song. Two threads. One physical, one arcane. Pulling them together… felt like reaching into the dark.

**SOUND:** [Music returns, a mix of the pulsing synth and unsettling ambient tones. It builds slightly.]

**SCENE END**

**EPISODE 2 END**

**EPISODE 3: The OmniCorp Protocol**

**Logline:** The disappearances hit the media. OmniCorp takes notice, focusing on PR control. Rourke is pressured by superiors and gets a new "partner," Dr. Naomi Turner, ostensibly a psychologist but likely a corporate plant.

**(RUNTIME: approx. 18 minutes)**

**MUSIC:** [Opens with a slick, corporate-sounding synth score, slightly sterile, then transitions to a tense, understated underscore.]

**SOUND:** [The low HUM of a busy police station. Distant phones ringing, chatter.]

**SCENE START**

**INT. PRECINCT BULLPEN - DAY**

**SOUND:** [Police station sounds. Rourke's desk terminal BEEPS.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** The quiet didn't last. TwinSun Strand likes its scandals loud. The disappearances were suddenly everywhere. On the news feeds, the data-nets. And when the public noticed, OmniCorp noticed. Not the missing people. The bad press.

**SOUND:** [News report audio fades in, slightly tinny.]

**NEWSCASTER:** ...concern is growing in TwinSun Strand following the fourth confirmed disappearance in as many weeks. While police are tight-lipped, sources indicate a potential link to the popular new arcade game, "Casilda's Song," manufactured by a subsidiary of the global conglomerate, OmniCorp. OmniCorp representatives have released a statement expressing "deep sympathy" and stating they are "fully cooperating" with authorities, while emphasizing there is "no evidence" linking their product to any criminal activity. Shares in OmniCorp saw a slight dip in early trading…

**SOUND:** [News report audio fades out as Rourke's desk phone RINGS.]

**ROURKE:** (Sighs) Yeah, Rourke.

**DETECTIVE HARRISON:** (Voice curt, stressed) Rourke! My office. Now.

**ROURKE:** On my way.

**SOUND:** [Phone CLICKS off. Rourke stands up. Chair SCRAPES.]

**SCENE END**

**SCENE START**

**INT. HARRISON'S OFFICE - DAY**

**SOUND:** [More sterile than the bullpen. Quiet HUM of executive tech.]

**SOUND:** [Rourke's footsteps stop.]

**HARRISON:** (Slams a folder onto the desk) Look at this, Rourke! Disappearances linked to a children's game? The Mayor's office is on my neck! OmniCorp's legal team is leaning on Internal Affairs! They want this shut down! Yesterday!

**ROURKE:** Sir, the evidence…

**HARRISON:** There *is* no evidence! Not according to OmniCorp! Just speculation, a few weird coincidences! You talk about audio diaries, cursed melodies… What is this, some kind of occult conspiracy fantasy?

**ROURKE:** I'm following leads, Harrison. Thorne's audio file is real. His game cabinet is real. The disappearances are real!

**HARRISON:** And OmniCorp says the game is standard, the cabinet passed quality control, and Thorne likely ran off to join a cult or got into some digital debt he couldn't repay! They've even assigned a liaison! Says she's a psychologist. Specialized in… (Reads from folder) …"digital wellness and immersive media impacts." Says she's here to "assist" you. Bullshit. She's here to manage the narrative. Her name's Dr. Naomi Turner. She starts today.

**SOUND:** [A door OPENS.]

**HARRISON:** Speak of the devil. Dr. Turner, this is Detective Rourke. He's the one who's managed to turn a few missing person cases into a city-wide panic.

**SOUND:** [Turner walks in. Her footsteps are crisp, professional.]

**DR. TURNER:** Detective Rourke. Dr. Naomi Turner. Thank you for allowing me to observe and provide… (A slight pause) …context.

**ROURKE:** (Voice dry) Context. Right. For the ghosts showing up in the system logs?

**DR. TURNER:** My understanding, Detective, is that you've encountered some… unusual data anomalies. My expertise is in the psychological effects of prolonged interaction with digital environments and highly addictive software. "Casilda's Song" is designed to be incredibly immersive and rewarding. It’s plausible, though unfortunate, that some individuals with pre-existing psychological vulnerabilities could become… overwhelmed. Perhaps even suffer dissociative episodes or develop delusional fixations leading them to… relocate.

**ROURKE:** Relocate? They vanished from locked rooms, Doctor. After listening to recordings talking about yellow kings and fictional cities. That's not relocation, that's evaporation.

**DR. TURNER:** (Voice cool, professional) Respectfully, Detective, without empirical evidence of physical impossibility, psychological explanations are the most rational starting point. Perhaps the locked room wasn't as secure as assumed. Perhaps the audio file was a pre-existing delusion recorded before the subject willingly left. We need to investigate the *players*, not just the game code. What were their psychological profiles? Their vulnerabilities?

**HARRISON:** See, Rourke? Dr. Turner has the right approach. Scientific. Measurable. You work with her. Keep her informed. And keep this quiet! No more leaks! I don't want to hear another word about cursed melodies or ancient cities unless it's in a forensics report or a psychological evaluation signed by the Doctor! Understood?

**ROURKE:** (Beat, grudgingly) Understood.

**DR. TURNER:** I look forward to collaborating, Detective.

**ROURKE:** (Quietly, to himself) Yeah. Collaboration. Right.

**SOUND:** [Music returns, tense and underscores the corporate power dynamic.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** Turner was sharp. Too sharp to be just a psychologist. She had that look OmniCorp hires – clean, focused, utterly blind to anything that doesn't fit the quarterly report. A handler, not a helper. They weren't just burying the story. They were trying to sanitize the truth. And they'd put her on my team to make sure I didn't dig too deep.

**SOUND:** [Music swells slightly, then fades out.]

**EPISODE 3 END**

---

**EPISODE 4: The Yellow Sign Begins to Flicker**

**Logline:** Neon Shadow finds the game's code is strangely alive and resistant. The Yellow Sign makes its first subtle appearance in the digital static. Ghost Caldwell warns Rourke of the Sign's ancient significance, showing him disturbing texts. Dr. Turner documents cases of extreme obsession linked to the game.

**(RUNTIME: approx. 20 minutes)**

**MUSIC:** [Opens with unsettling, low-frequency drones mixed with faint, high-pitched digital WHINES. Builds suspense.]

**SOUND:** [The constant, intense sounds of Neon Shadow's systems – rapid typing, data streams, complex processing. More frantic now.]

**SCENE START**

**INT. NEON SHADOW'S DEN - NIGHT**

**NEON SHADOW:** (Voice tight, focused, almost stressed) Rourke? You there?

**ROURKE:** (Over comms) Yeah, Shadow. What's up? You sound… ruffled. Code giving you trouble?

**NEON SHADOW:** Trouble doesn't cover it. This isn't just complex code, Rourke. It's… adversarial. Like it knows I'm here. Every time I try to probe a subroutine, it shifts. Alters itself. Like a virus learning to evade detection.

**ROURKE:** A learning algorithm? OmniCorp playing with advanced AI for a game?

**NEON SHADOW:** This isn't AI, Rourke. Not in any standard sense. There's no central processing unit I can trace it back to. It's distributed. Like… the code itself is alive. Or it's being driven by something external. Something that *hates* being analyzed.

**SOUND:** [A sudden, violent burst of DIGITAL NOISE and FEEDBACK.]

**NEON SHADOW:** Whoa! System crash! Dammit! It just firewalled my primary probe! That shouldn't be possible with this hardware!

**ROURKE:** You okay?

**NEON SHADOW:** (Breathing heavily) Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Just… shaken. That felt… personal. Like a rejection. A violent one.

**ROURKE:** Anything before it crashed? Any progress?

**NEON SHADOW:** (Typing slowly, recovering systems) Partial dump. Fragments. I saw… something in the data stream. Like a brief image. Corrupted. Flashing in the static. Gone before I could grab it clean. Looked like… a symbol. Jagged lines. Yellow… It was yellow.

**ROURKE:** Yellow. The victim mentioned yellow. And Caldwell… the old archivist… he talked about a King in Yellow.

**NEON SHADOW:** (Voice distant) A King… in the code? This is getting way beyond malware, Rourke. This feels… unnatural. Like code shouldn't be able to *do* this. Fight back like this. It's leaving echoes… psychic residue in my system logs. Weird humming sounds I can't filter out.

**ROURKE:** Get a clean environment setup. Sandbox it completely. Whatever this thing is, it's spreading. Caldwell warned me it was trying to get in.

**NEON SHADOW:** (Quietly) It's already in, Rourke. Just scratching at the walls. Let me see if I can isolate that visual fragment. And maybe… reinforce my mental firewalls. This isn't just digital intrusion anymore.

**SOUND:** [Intense tech sounds resume, but with a new underlying tension.]

**SCENE END**

**SCENE START**

**INT. GHOST CALDWELL'S ARCHIVE - DAY**

**SOUND:** [Dusty silence. The dry RUSTLE of ancient paper.]

**SOUND:** [Rourke's footsteps, heavier this time, more urgent.]

**ROURKE:** Mr. Caldwell! Elijah!

**SOUND:** [Quick, anxious shuffling approaches.]

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Voice agitated) You came back! You saw it, didn't you? The Sign!

**ROURKE:** The Sign? What Sign? Neon Shadow just saw a flash of yellow in the game's data. A symbol.

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (GRABS Rourke's arm - SFX of frail hand gripping fabric) That's it! The Yellow Sign! The mark of the King! It means it's working! The play is manifesting!

**ROURKE:** What are you talking about, Caldwell? A symbol in code?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Pulls Rourke deeper into the archive - RUSTLING of paper, movement) Look! Look at this! (Heaves a heavy, brittle book onto a table - THUD, paper CRACKS) This is from before. Before everything. Copies of the texts. Forbidden. Look at the illuminations!

**SOUND:** [Caldwell flips through pages - dry, brittle SOUND.]

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Pointing) There! And there! And in the margin here! The Sign! Always the Sign! It appears when the King's influence spreads! In art! In dreams! In… in *reality*! It's a key! A distortion! It means the border is thinning! Carcosa is pressing through!

**ROURKE:** (Looking at the sounds of the pages, the description of the symbol) It matches what Shadow described. Jagged. Yellow.

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Voice frantic) It's not just a symbol, detective! It's a psychic imprint! A memetic trigger! Seeing it, hearing the melody… it softens the mind! Makes you… susceptible! To the play! To the King's gaze! The game is embedding the Sign! Everywhere! In the code! In the *minds* of the players!

**ROURKE:** So the paranoia, the obsession Dr. Turner is seeing… that's the 'softening'?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** Precisely! The first stage! The hook! Then comes Act Two! The part that breaks you! The part that leaves the body behind and draws you… home!

**ROURKE:** Home to Carcosa? You said you encountered this before. How did you learn about the Sign?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Voice drops, haunted) We saw it. In visions. In the eyes of those who… read too deep. It branded itself on their minds. Some scratched their eyes out to un-see it. Didn't work. You can't un-see what's burned onto your soul.

**ROURKE:** How do we fight something that's a symbol, a melody, a code, and some kind of mental infection?

**GHOST CALDWELL:** (Shakes his head) Fight it? You can't fight a dream, detective. Not with guns and badges. You can only… try to wake up. Or contain the nightmare. And the Sign… it means the nightmare is escaping. The city is starting to dream… in yellow.

**SOUND:** [Caldwell sinks onto a chair - CREAK. The rustling stops.]

**SCENE END**

**SCENE START**

**INT. DR. TURNER'S CLINICAL OFFICE/LAB - DAY**

**SOUND:** [Sterile lab environment. Soft HUM of diagnostic equipment. Clinical, quiet.]

**SOUND:** [Dr. Turner is dictating notes. Her voice is professional, but with a hint of strain.]

**DR. TURNER:** (Dictating) Patient 7-B. Subject exhibits classic symptoms of extreme immersion addiction regarding "Casilda's Song." However, the intensity and rapid onset are anomalous. Not responding to standard cognitive therapies. Expressing increasing paranoia, fixating on specific color palettes – notably shades of yellow. Claims to "see patterns" in everyday objects. Exhibiting compulsive humming of a simple, repetitive melody – identified by audio analysis as a core sound loop from the game, though subtly altered…

**SOUND:** [Turner pauses, taps on a tablet screen - light BEEPING.]

**DR. TURNER:** (Dictating) Patient 9-D. Subject presented yesterday. Already exhibiting stage two symptoms. Accusations of surveillance, auditory hallucinations described as "whispering voices" urging them to "find the path." Refuses to look at certain images or colours, specifically yellow. When presented with a yellow object during testing, subject experienced acute panic and reported seeing a "jagged mark" overlaid on my face…

**SOUND:** [Turner stops dictating. Sighs deeply.]

**DR. TURNER:** (To herself) A jagged mark… Multiple subjects reporting visual disturbances related to yellow… It's not just addiction. It's something… inducing a shared hallucination? A mass delusion? But how could a game… Unless it's triggering something latent… Or implanting something active. (She looks at her screen, sees a complex data readout) The neural feedback loops… they're correlating precisely with specific visual and auditory stimuli from the game's core programming… This isn't coincidence.

**SOUND:** [A faint, high-pitched WHINE emanates from her equipment. She jumps slightly.]

**DR. TURNER:** (Voice nervous) What was that? System anomaly? No… Diagnostics are clear… (She listens) It sounds… like… like the game melody… but it's not possible…

**SOUND:** [The faint melody continues for a second, then vanishes.]

**DR. TURNER:** (Shaken) Focus, Naomi. Rational explanations. Interference. A rogue signal. (She tries to hum the melody she described earlier – her humming is slightly off, hesitant, but the same tune Jenkins hummed in Episode 1.) Why can't I get this tune out of my head?

**SOUND:** [Music returns, building tension. Mixes the sterile corporate sound with the unsettling drones and the ghost of the melody.]

**NARRATOR (ROURKE):** Shadow saw the Sign flicker in the code. Caldwell saw it in ancient texts, warned it meant the border was thin. And Turner, the scientist, was seeing its effects manifest in the minds of the victims. Paranoia, shared visions, humming that damn tune. It wasn't just a game anymore. It was becoming… pervasive. A stain spreading through the city's network, its history, and the minds of its people. The Yellow Sign wasn't just a symbol. It was a promise. And it was starting to glow.

**SOUND:** [Music swells, incorporating glitchy, unsettling sounds and a brief, distorted fragment of the "Casilda's Song" melody. Ends with a jarring CUT to silence.]

**EPISODE 4 END**

**(SCRIPT ENDS HERE - CONTINUES IN EPISODE 5)**

***

This concludes the script for the first four episodes of "Casilda's Requiem," establishing the key characters, the central mystery, the blending of cyberpunk and Lovecraftian themes, and the encroaching threat of the King in Yellow via the "Casilda's Song" game. The formatting includes cues for SFX, Music, character names, and Rourke's noir-style narration, adhering to radio drama standards. The tone is set, and the initial plot points from the outline have been covered. The narrative is left at a point where the horror is clearly non-mundane and beginning to affect the city and the team.
